Monthly Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

For our week 6 weekend challenge, we were given the task to develop a calculator to collect employee data and list them on a table. Amongst all the employees entered, we were asked to compute the average monthly cost of all the employees annual salaries. We also need to be able to remove an employee and update the DOM to reflect the new monthly total. If the monthly total exceeds $20,000, change the background of the monthly total to red and then back to the original background if the monthly total is below $20,000.

## Usage

How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Enter employee information into the input fields.
2. Calculator will display the average monthly cost of all the employees annual salaries.
3. Individual employees can be removed and the total monthly salary will update.
4. If the total monthly salary is above $20,000, the background color will turn red.


## Built With
